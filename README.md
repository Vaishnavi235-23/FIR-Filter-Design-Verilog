# FIR Filter Design (Verilog)

## Description
This project implements an 8-tap Finite Impulse Response (FIR) digital filter
using Verilog HDL. The design is verified using a testbench simulation.

## Files
- fir_filter.v : FIR filter module
- fir_filter_tb.v : Testbench for verification

## Tools Used
- Verilog HDL
- EDA Playground

## Simulation
The design was simulated and verified in EDA Playground.
